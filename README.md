# NOALBS

Simple app to automatically switch scenes in OBS Studio/OBS.Live based on the current bitrate fetched from the server stats.

---

NOALBS is used as a DIY tool to have your OBS Studio/OBS.Live auto switch scenes when you are either in a LOW bitrate situation or if your source disconnects completely.

## Chat Commands

This script gives you the option to enable some simple chat commands to help you manage your stream from your own Twitch chat, here is how to use them:

> Please note: Admins are all the users in the `admins` array in `chat` config section, MODs are all of your MODs, and Public is anyone in your chat.

| Default Role | Command                  | Description                                                                                             | Example            |

|    Admins    | !noalbs instant      | toggle instant switching from offline scene.               | !noalbs instant |

## Configure NOALBS

Rename `.env.example` to `.env`. Fill in your bot username and oauth.

Use <https://twitchapps.com/tmi> to get your oauth from Twitch.

> We recommend using your main Twitch BOT account for this, but if you do not have a Twitch Bot account just use your Main Twitch Account.

The `config.json` file holds all the user configurations.

### Stream servers section

Currently NOALBS supports [NGINX](#using-nginx), [Nimble](#using-nimble-streamer-server-with-srt-protocol), [Node Media Server](#using-an-external-node-media-server), [SRT Live Server](#using-sls-srt-live-server) and [BELABOX](#using-belabox-cloud).
You can have as many servers as you want to use in the config.

Example stream server object:

```json
{
  "streamServer": {
    "type": "Nginx",
    "statsUrl": "http://localhost/stats",
    "application": "publish",
    "key": "live"
  },
  "name": "nginx",
  "priority": 0,
  "overrideScenes": {
    "normal": "normal",
    "low": "low",
    "offline": "offline"
  },
  "dependsOn": null
}
```

- `streamServer`: Replace this with the [server](#stream-server-objects) you would like to use
- `name`: A unique name to distinguish the server
- `priority`: Decides which stream server to monitor when multiple are online. 0 is consired the highest.
- `overrideScenes`: Optional field to override the default scenes
- `dependsOn`: Optional field explained [here](#depends-on)

### Stream server objects

#### Using NGINX

```JSON
  "streamServer": {
    "type": "Nginx",
    "statsUrl": "http://localhost/stats",
    "application": "publish",
    "key": "live"
  },
```

---

#### Using an external Node-Media-Server

```JSON
"streamServer": {
  "type": "NodeMediaServer",
  "statsUrl": "http://localhost:8000/api/streams",
  "application": "publish",
  "key": "live",
  "auth": {
    "username": "admin",
    "password": "admin"
  }
},
```

- `auth`: Optional field

---

#### Using Nimble Streamer Server (with SRT protocol)

Nimble must have [API access enabled](https://wmspanel.com/nimble/api) and be configured as a SRT receiver - see ["Set up receiving of SRT"](https://blog.wmspanel.com/2017/07/setup-srt-secure-reliable-transport-nimble-streamer.html) and have an outgoing stream ("Add outgoing stream" on same page)

```JSON
"streamServer": {
  "type": "Nimble",
  "statsUrl": "http://nimble:8082",
  "id": "0.0.0.0:1234",
  "application": "live",
  "key": "srt",
},
```

- `statsUrl`: URL to nimble API
- `id`: UDP listener ID (Usually IP:Port)
- `application`: Outgoing stream "Application Name"
- `key`: Outgoing stream "Stream Name"

> Switches on low bitrate or high RTT (high RTT seems to be a more accurate way of determining if the stream is bad with this)
You can change the high RTT trigger value inside config.json

---

#### Using SLS (SRT-LIVE-SERVER)

> Big Thanks to [oozebrood](https://www.twitch.tv/oozebrood), [matthewwb2](https://www.twitch.tv/matthewwb2), and [kyle___d](https://www.twitch.tv/kyle___d) for all of the hard work they've put into getting SRT to the masses!
If you're using either [Matt's modified version](https://gitlab.com/mattwb65/srt-live-server) or
[my edit of Matt's version](https://hub.docker.com/r/b3ckontwitch/sls-b3ck-edit) of SLS then follow this section;

```JSON
"streamServer": {
  "type": "SrtLiveServer",
  "statsUrl": "http://localhost:8181/stats",
  "publisher": "publish/live/feed1"
},
```

- `stats`: URL to SLS stats page (ex; <http://localhost:8181/stats> )
- `publisher`: StreamID of the where you are publishing the feed. (ex; publish/live/feed1 )

- Publisher, what is a publisher? it's a combination of `domain_publisher`/`app_publisher`/`<whatever-you-want>`.
  - So if your `domain_publisher` was "uplive.sls.com", and your `app_publisher` was "live", it would be `uplive.sls.com/live/<whatever-you-want>`.
  - You could literally call you domain_publisher 'billy', app_publisher 'bob', and then set your streamid (publisher) to 'billy/bob/thorton' if you wanted to.
  - Publisher is also what you entered in the config under `default_sid`.  Unless you are streaming to a different 'StreamID' of course, ex; `publish/live/tinkerbell`.

See Example Below from the `sls.conf` file in the SLS main directory:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1740542/94368739-7955b600-00ab-11eb-9946-20b66f9f4fb2.png)

So in actuality your 'publisher' is your default `StreamID`, like in the example above it's `billy/bob/thorton`.

> Switches on low bitrate or high RTT (high RTT seems to be a more accurate way of determining if the stream is bad with this)
You can change the high RTT trigger value inside config.json:

##### How do I publish to the SLS Server?

see [HERE](https://gitlab.com/mattwb65/srt-live-server#1test-with-ffmpeg)

##### How do I pull the SRT feed into OBS?

- Add Media Source
- Un-check `Local File`
- Make sure `Restart playback when source becomes active` is checked.
- Change Network Buffering to `1 MB`
- In the "Input" field enter in: `srt://<SERVER-IP>:<PORT>/?streamid=<PUBLISHER>`
  - Using the example from the above image, it would be something like this if you are using SLS on the same machine: `srt://localhost:30000/?streamid=jojo/bob/thorton`
- In the `Input Format` field enter in: `mpegts`
- Change `Reconnect Delay` to `3S` (Three Seconds)
- Make sure `Show nothing when playback ends` is checked.
- Check `Close file when inactive`
- Optional: If your streams color looks washed out change your `YUV Color Range` to `Partial`
- Sidenote: Do not Use `Use hardware decoding when available`, `Apply alpha in linear space`, or `Seekable`, As I have only ran into issues with these options enabled.

Below is an example when used with a BelaBox Reciever:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1740542/147401054-9b99d8ea-4388-441d-a965-4e0924de30e2.png)

Remember this is just an example, your ports and streamid may differ.

#### Using BELABOX cloud

```JSON
  "streamServer": {
    "type": "Belabox",
    "statsUrl": "http://belabox-stats-url/yourkey",
    "publisher": "yourkey"
  },
```

You should be able to find the details in your [BELABOX cloud](https://cloud.belabox.net) account.

### Depends on

When a `dependsOn` field is found, monitor the status of the given server. If that server goes offline the `backupScenes` will be used.

```JSON
"dependsOn": {
  "name": "nginx",
  "backupScenes": {
    "normal": "Scene 3",
    "low": "low",
    "offline": "Scene 2"
  }
}
```

- `name`: The exact name this stream server depends on
- `backupScenes`: Scenes that will be used when the depended on server is offline

## FAQ

### Need additional help?

You can always contact us on discord @ b3ck#3517 or 715209#0600 and we'll do our best to help out.

### I want to keep using the old version

You can find the old NOALBS version in the [master branch](https://github.com/715209/nginx-obs-automatic-low-bitrate-switching/tree/master).

### NGINX Setup

If you already have NGINX-RTMP server

- Replace your `nginx.conf` with the one given here.
- Put `stat.xsl` in your nginx `html` folder.

Otherwise here is a Windows version of NGINX+RTMP Server

- [Hosted on Github](https://github.com/715209/nginx-obs-automatic-low-bitrate-switching/raw/master/nginx/nginx_1.7.11.3_Gryphon_With_NOALBS.config_files_03162020.zip)
- Everything is ready to go inside this zip, just extract and click on the `nginx_start.bat` file to start NGINX, you can use `nginx_stop.bat` to stop NGINX. HTTP server runs on Port `80`, RTMP server runs on `1935`, if you need to edit the config file it's in the `/conf` folder, named `nginx.conf`.

---

### How to publish to your NGINX RTMP Server

Using the default config where the server is listening on port `1935` and the name of the application in NGINX is `publish`;

<sub>_(example config, do not copy)_</sub>

```NGINX
rtmp {
    server {
        listen 1935;
        (...)
        
        # Stream to "rtmp://IPHERE/publish/live".
        application publish {
            live on;
            (...)
        }
    }
}
```

- If the app or device requires the key separately put `rtmp://(SERVER-IP):1935/publish` in the RTMP URL and `live` in the key.
- Otherwise if the app or device doesn't require the key separately put `rtmp://(SERVER-IP):1935/publish/live` in the RTMP URL.

Most of these rules apply to the rest of the other types of servers;

- RTMP will usually have an `application` and a `key`.
- SRT will use a `publisher` ID or `streamid`, some applications or devices will only require your server IP and PORT;
  - Example; `srt://(SERVER-IP):30000` but if it the app or device supports `streamid` it will always be separate.

Either way, pay close attention to your app or device requirements, as you will need to setup accordingly to them and your configuration on the server.

### How to pull RTMP stream into OBS

Update your OBS to v26+ and follow the steps below:

1.) In OBS create the following scenes:

- `LIVE`, `LOW`, `BRB`, `REFRESH`
- I highly recommend creating a `STARTUP` & `PRIVACY` scene, the `STARTUP` scene can contain whatever you want to start your stream on and then switch to `LIVE` when you're ready, the `PRIVACY` scene can be whatever you want to put the stream on when you need privacy, the main thing is that it's out of NOALBS scope and won't automatically switch scenes.
- The normal flow is to have your OBS on `STARTUP` when you start stream and when you're ready either you or an instructed MOD can !switch LIVE, when you need privacy use !switch PRIVACY.

2.) In your `LIVE` scene, add a 'Media Source', match the image below:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1740542/113238763-05b97f00-926f-11eb-86d2-d9aabf94bf08.png)

- Right click on the 'Media Source' > Transform > Stretch to screen (this will stretch the video source no matter the resolution, ex; 480p, 720p, 1080p etc.)

3.) Copy and Paste(Reference) the 'Media Source' from the `LIVE` scene into your `LOW` scene.

- Do the same transformation procedure from step (2).

4.) Go over all of your scenes and make them your own.

### How to run with multiple users

In the `.env` file add the line `CONFIG_DIR=configs` where `configs` is the folder that holds all the config files. The name of the config is ignored so you can name it anything you want.

---

### Help it won't change scenes

It will only change scenes when OBS is set on a scene that's in the config.  
(This is so that it wont change when you are on for example your 'intro' or 'locked-brb' scene)
